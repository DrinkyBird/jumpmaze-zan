- (MAP40) Gravity Chambers by Wirtualnosc

# General
- Added a credits list.
- Changed the format of MAPINFO lump to the new format.

  Jumpmaze actions--like showing the map record details--in the key 
  customization menu.
- Shifted maps MAP33 and MAP51 from v5 to MAP51 and MAP58 in v6, respectively.

- Fixed the auto-fist script.
- Made some changes to the WhoExited script to hopefully keep the message
  from ever appearing at the left corner of the player's screen.
- Made some small changes to the timer codebase. Hopefully these changes will
  fix the glitch where the par time sometimes does not appear. I'm still not
  certain as to what might cause the glitch, but I have a pretty good idea.
- Improved the internal structure of many of the scripts and added minor
  upgrades to some.

- Added height to some teleport destinations.

# MAP42 -- Lost Halls
- Changed some metal floor textures that were of the wrong orientation.
- Fixed a mismatched texture at the finish area.
- Added metal bars to all open windows. It makes no sense to have windows that
  block the player when open. The bars make the windows look better, too.
- Made the teleports at the finish area of the first three sections teleport
  the player outside the section they were in.

- Added an updated version of the map by AC3.

# MAP44 -- Jumpmaze HQ

  orientation.

      at the exit area you get 30 fps, now you get 60 - 70 fps.
    " Arranged the entire map, to aglin many textures.
- Intermission pic removed.

# MAP52 -- Vivid Dreams, Sweetheart
- Added more detail throughout the map and made it look more realistic
  and consistent.

- Made some parts a bit easier.
- Changed music.
- Removed intermission pic.

# MAP54 -- Airship Doomed
- Included an updated version of the map from Master Garo.
- Map title changed.

# MAP55 -- Bloody Donation
- Major upgrade performed on map.
- Changed music.

# MAP56 -- Red Hot Ride
- Changed name.
- Added updated version. From AC3:
    " Improved the message of the song secret area. The message displayed
      will show only one time.
    " The exit area is now in a boat. The past switch is to open the door.
    " Reduced the size of the music level.
    " The annoying "Red Fog" is no more.
    " 10% easier.
    " * The mirror can't display properly when you enter in the song sec

- Separated the music/sound and extra-textures/rest into separate wads.
- Removed unsused textures that were previously used in the now discarded
  Mario and Contra maps.

  the static par time was sent every second with the current map time.
- Fixed DECORATE warnings on startup.
- Fixed unknown patches and textures warnings on startup of Skulltag.

  separate libraries. They can now be updated without having to

  PK3 structure looks like.

  the middle and in the sector after the two lamps.

  and after the fans.

  would have allowed a player to escape the map.

# MAP39 -- Escaping from Hell

  ceilings in the imp part.

- Added an extra pillar near the High Jump rune so players don't have to
  fall down and teleport back to start of the area.

# MAP41 -- Eternal Void

- Made the red, green, and blue switches teleport the player to the 
  starting area of those areas, and the white and orange

  the starting position of that area instead of having to go down
  into the lava to do that.

  Souls. This is due to the finish line being outside the pillars
  that are lowered when the Lost Souls are killed.

  the blue card.

  after being pressed.

  of the first sector in the Hell part.
- Closed the cages both sides in the first tunnel of the Hell part, 
  near the two Candelabras.

# MAP46 -- Blocks of Doom
- Made the key placed messages have the same line ID to avoid messing up the
  display when two keys are placed simultaneously. Also made the messages log
  into the console for future reference.

# MAP47 -- Infer's Hell
- Made the messages of the first two switches more helpful.

# MAP48 -- Escaping From the Horror
- Fixed the missing "N" texture error at startup in console.
