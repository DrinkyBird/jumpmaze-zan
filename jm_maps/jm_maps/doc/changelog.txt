===============================================================================

General
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Upgraded all the utility scripts, such as the jumpmaze rankers.
- Added a new game mode called Survival Maze, enabled by playing in Survival.
- Some maps had the clear inventory function calls in an OPEN script, causing
  them to be called only on map start and not when the player enters the game,
  so I changed it into an ENTER script.
- Changed the script numbers of some scripts to something below 900, because
  all script numbers above and including 900 are reserved for the utility
  scripts.
