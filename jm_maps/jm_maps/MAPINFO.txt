"	Well done! You've learned the basis of
jumping! You're on your way to becoming a
master platformer. The road ahead is
long and tough, and there will be many 
mistakes made, but don't give up hope. 


	These next maps will test your skill in
basic jumps, and will introduce using lamps,
torches, and actors to get around areas.



Welcome to the Easy maps. Good luck!"

"	Impressive! It seems that you have
learned new ways to jump around maps.
Mastering the use of jumping on actors
will come in handy as you continue to
progress on to more difficult maps.

	The upcoming maps are a little
more challenging than what you have
experienced. Learn the bunny hop in order
to reach gaps further away than previous
maps.

Now you have reached the Moderate maps.
Watch your step!"

"	After completing the moderate maps
you feel like taking a break right?

Wrong!

From here on, the maps will only get
harder as you progress. It is here
where you must put actor jumping to
the test. Platforms are smaller as
well, so learn how to stop fast
to prevent yourself from falling.

The real challenge begins here.

Good luck playing the Hard maps..."

"	A wise man once said...
''Only by practice can you learn the way...''

After completing many challenges, you look
back to reflect on what you have learned.
Strafe jumping, actor jumps,
bunny hopping and hard braking.
How could simple jumping be this
difficult and complex?
You turn forward, and prepare for the final
challenges that await. Bridge jumping,
projectile evasion...
The true test of platformers was
about to begin.

You prepared yourself for the real
challenge...the Very Hard maps..."

"	Congratulations! You have made it
through a lot of pain and suffering!
You slowly make your way out of the icon's
brain and walk away to rest.

You turn your head back to the giant demon
and realize that it was only weakened. The
Icon will live on...

Realizing you are too weak to re-enter the
Icon, you turn away, start to walk, and wait
for the day when another platformer can
continue where you failed..."

"	After throwing your body into the heart,
a large explosion starts inside the icon.

Legends have told about the legendary
platformer who chose a path of trials
and determination.
That legendary platformer, who took the
route that no other platformer would take,
lived on to defeat the strongest of demons...
the Icon.
To this day that legend is still told...
That legendary platformer...is you.

Cngratulations on completing Jump Maze!
As a victory gift, enjoy these two secret
maps! They aren't easy, so good luck!

"	Congratulations! You've completed all 32
maps! You must feel proud of yourself after all
that pain and swearing at your computer
screen. After that long road, you should
probably take a rest now, maybe go find
another game, or even go outside for a bit
to relax...

...or you could play again, and this time see
if you have improved by beating the par times
on each map.
The choice is up to you though...

Thanks for playing Jump Maze!
